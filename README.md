# HeatDistortionShaderNez
An example project to show use of a heat distortion shader in Nez with Monogame

If you are having trouble where it says Nez can't build, try opening the Nez solution, retoring Nuget packages and then building that. Then return to your solution and try building again per https://github.com/prime31/Nez/issues/433
