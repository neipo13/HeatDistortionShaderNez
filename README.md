# HeatDistortionShaderNez
An example project to show use of a heat distortion shader in Nez with Monogame. Used in blog post https://blog.andrewnapierkowski.com/heat-distortion-explosions-in-nez/.

When cloning locally, be sure to include submodules in order to pull in Nez as well. If you are having trouble where it says Nez can't build, try opening the Nez solution, retoring Nuget packages and then building that. Then return to your solution and try building again per https://github.com/prime31/Nez/issues/433

Based on  https://twitter.com/rilemtwit/status/1083758729441525760 and https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/05/03/animated-heat-distortion-effects-webgl/.

If trying to see the effect, just click anywhere on screen to create an explosion and see the effect in action!
